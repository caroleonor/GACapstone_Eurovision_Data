# How the voting system works?
After viewers have cast their votes by telephone, SMS or using the official app, each national spokesperson from the participating countries will be called in to present the points of their professional jury.

After the presentation of the scores from the juries, the televoting points from all participating countries will be combined, providing one score for each song. These televoting results will then be announced by the presenters.

In 2019, the presentation of the votes changes slightly. The order in which the televoting results are revealed is determined by the ranking of the jury result. The announcement of the televoting results will start with the country receiving the fewest points from the juries and end with the country that received the highest points from the juries. The presenters shall announce the sum of points that each song has received from the votes of the televote across all participating countries.
